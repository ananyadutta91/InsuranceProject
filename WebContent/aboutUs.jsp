<h1>About Us</h1>
 </center>

Page Insurance Agency is a locally owned and operated independent insurance agency. This means that we do not represent just one insurance company, we represent several insurance carriers. Our agency has access to numerous A-rated carriers, which better enables us to meet the individual needs of our clients. This also allows our clients to stay with us even as their insurance needs evolve or change over time.

We pride ourselves in being active in the communities in which we provide our services. The following is a list of some of the organizations and associations we are affiliated with:

DeLand Area Chamber of Commerce	Mainstreet DeLand Association
Rotary Club of Downtown DeLand	DeLand Women's Organization
Florida Association of Insurance Agents	Florida Hospital - DeLand
Associated Builders & Contractors	Volusia Building Industry Association
Florida Home Builders Association	National Association of Home Builders

With decades of experience providing insurance services in DeLand, Florida; the Page Insurance Agency is one of the leading independent insurance agencies in West Volusia. In 1977, Page Insurance Agency merged with Conrad Company, making our service date back to 1924. Over the years, our services have expanded to all of Central Florida. Being in business for several decades, has allowed our agency to develop and maintain strong relationships with top insurance companies, which ultimately allows us to have more options to provide to our clients.
